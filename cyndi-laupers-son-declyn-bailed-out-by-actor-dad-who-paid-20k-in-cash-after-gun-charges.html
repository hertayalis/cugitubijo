after <a href=#>allegedly being caught with a gun</a> — when his actor dad footed his bail by paying with cold, hard cash.</p><p>Lauper’s husband and “Law & Order” actor David Thornton casually spent several minutes at a court cashier window with an attorney when he pulled $20,000 cash out from a white envelope to pay bail after his rapper son, Declan “Dex” Lauper, was arraigned on gun possession charges in the aftermath of a shooting in Harlem Wednesday night.</p><p>Pictures showed Thornton carrying several $100 bills stacked together in a brick, which was confirmed later by a courthouse source.</p><p>Thornton, who also appeared in “The Notebook,” was flanked by a man wearing an earpiece as he sat inside the courtroom.</p><p>Prosecutors alleged that Lauper, 28, and another man took an Uber ride from Queens to 135th West 112th St.&nbsp;when the driver allegedly heard them say, “It has already been sold.”</p><p>That’s when the rapper’s car was then swarmed by five armed individuals and a shot was fired, striking Lauper’s partner in the leg, prosecutors alleged.</p><p>He was allegedly seen wearing a black fanny pack with white writing on it and asked responding offers to retrieve a blue bag from his ride, so the other man’s mom could pick it up at a smoke shop.</p><p>But when police followed Lauper into the store, they noticed blood on his shoe and found a gun in his black fanny pack, prosecutors said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Cyndi Lauper’s troubled son Declyn avoided a weekend at Rikers after allegedly being

found at the scene where the victim was shot, according to a criminal complaint.</p><p>“The defendant and the separately apprehended individual drove to the location both with firearms to engage in what appears to be illicit activity,” Assistant District Attorney Harriet Jiranek said in court.</p><p>Law enforcement sources said that drugs were also found on Lauper at the time of his arrest, which he was not charged for.</p><p>Prosecutors were seeking $50,000 cash bail but Lauper’s attorney, Steven Brill, made his case for letting him out without bail, explaining that Lauper has been working with a life coach to point him in the right “direction.”</p><p>“My point of bringing that out is that you have another layer of supervision that he’s privately engaged to have him seen and be there for him given when he’s released during the pendency with this case,” Brill said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Lauper’s husband and “Law &

to complete five days of community service and stay out of trouble for a year.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Law enforcement sources said that

the legendary “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” singer — celebrated his springing from jail by proclaiming his freedom.</p><p>“Positive energy equals positive results,” he said on a Manhattan street.</p><p>“The King of New York is on bail!”</p><p>Meanwhile, his dad was mum when asked about his son’s alleged conduct.</p><p>Lauper is due back in court on Feb. 13.</p><p class=postsid
