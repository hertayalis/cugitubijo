Her annual income is said to be more than $75,000 per year.</p><h2><span id=Katie_Fehlinger-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Katie Fehlinger- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Katie was born on July 1, 1974, in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, under the sign of Cancer, and she is of American nationality as well as white ethnicity. Further information about her family’s background and her parents has never been made public, thus there isn’t much pertinent information about her early upbringing other than the fact that she was reared alongside one brother by a single mother.</p><p>Katie’s education began when she graduated from a local high school and continued her studies at Cedar Crest College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where she later graduated with honors and obtained her Bachelor of Arts degree in communications. She worked for AccuWeather, Inc. during her studies since she was interested in meteorology.</p><p>Katie continued her studies after high school by enrolling at Mississippi State University in Starkville, where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in geology.

The pair married on the 24th of February 2012, while on holiday in Jamaica. They have two children – twins named Kaedan Faye and Parker Janice who were born on August 26, 2015.</p><p>Despite being subjected to body shaming during her pregnancy, Katie routinely appeared on-camera for the bulk of it (35 out of 40 weeks), and it only took her three months after her children were born to return to her professional duties in November 2015.</p><p>Aside from these, there are no more facts concerning Katie’s private life, which she has managed to keep secret and away from the media. Her relatives live in Delaware County, Pennsylvania.</p><h2><span id=Katie_Fehlinger-_Professional_Career>Katie Fehlinger- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Fehlinger’s professional career began in the early 2000s, when she joined the RCN 4 station in Bath, Pennsylvania, and began her journey into the world of broadcasting. During her early years, she also refined her professional talents by periodically contributing to the Emmy Award-winning news and magazine show “Tempo!” which aired on WLVT-TV, a Public Broadcasting Service member station.</p><p>Katie moved her professional broadcasting career focus to meteorology and weather casting in 2006. She covered the tornadoes that year for Fox News, covering the whole mid-western region of the United States. She also contributes to Fox Business and Sports Network programs. Throughout the following few years, Fehlinger honed her weather casting skills by working with CBS New York (commonly referred to as WCBS-TV), where she appeared in morning newscasts and weekend forecasting shows.</p><p>Katie had previously worked for numerous different TV stations, including ABC and ESPN, as well as the Big Ten Network, Yes TV, and NESN, before joining CBS3 in September 2011, where she is still a meteorologist. Katie can also be seen on WPSG-TV as a member of The CW Philly’s morning news program, in addition to her daily on-camera appearances on CBS3.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Katie has a slim and toned figure with a true hourglass silhouette, which, combined with her blonde hair and blue eyes, makes her look pretty beautiful. Although no data about her vital statistics have been disclosed, it has been established that she stands at a <strong>height</strong> of 5ft 5ins (1.65m) tall.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Details>Social Media Details</span></h2><p>Katie is quite active on various popular social media networks, including Instagram, where she has approximately 5,000 followers, Twitter, where her official account has almost 18,000 followers, and Facebook, where she has nearly 30,000 fans.</p><p>Katie has also been active on YouTube since January 2019, where she operates her own channel called Katie Fehlinger DIY.
