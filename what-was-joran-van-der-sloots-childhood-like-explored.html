At the center of the media circus was <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joran van der Sloot</a>,</strong> an affluent teen with a constantly shifting story and need to live on the edge. The then 17-year-old’s ever-changing alibi was problem enough, but his attempt to extort $250k from her mourning mother landed the heartless psychopath on everyone’s bad list. Joyously, van der Sloot confessed to the murder in 2023, and though <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Natalee’s remains will likely never be found</a>, her family can rest easier know this scumbag is behind bars.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>Natalee’s murder was far from the first crime van der Sloot committed. While his family has been fairly quiet about the whole affair, plenty of information has been uncovered about just how monstrous Joran van der Snoot was throughout his adolescence. It’s a frustrating situation compounded by the hindsight that his parents likely knew about his concerning behavior and chose to ignore it.</p><h2 id=h-joran-van-der-sloot-s-childhood data-injectable=false>Joran van der Sloot’s childhood</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=695 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>Van der Sloot grew up in Arnhem, the Netherlands alongside his two brothers. Their father, Paulus van der Sloot, was a lawyer specializing in government law. After fighting a lengthy battle against the Dutch government to save his family estate, he turned his ambitions toward securing a place as a judge in Aruba. Joran van der Sloot’s mother, Anita van der Sloot-Hugen, is, by all accounts, a shy woman. She has only rarely spoken to the media about her eldest son. The secretive woman (who can blame her) is an art teacher.</p><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>The family left the Netherlands when Joran was 10, so Paulus could take a position as an attorney within the Aruban government. The gorgeous island is a tourist’s paradise, and the island’s elite are a tightly knit group. With ample money (Paulus <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was allegedly worth $9 million</a> when he died in 2010), access to a wealth of nightlife, and a government official at his beck and call, Aruba was the perfect party place for a boy like Joran van der Sloot.</p><p data-characters=608 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true>Little is known about Joran van der Sloot’s academic life. His teachers and school have stayed tight-lipped about the troubled teen’s time at The International School of Aruba. His younger brother, Kees van der Spek, has been the main source of documentation around Joran’s aggressive behavior. From an early age, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">van der Sloot was a master manipulator</a> and a compulsive liar. On top of his propensity to fabricate stories, he had a temper and lashed out at those around him. Before his 16th birthday, van der Sloot had pushed a classmate through a glass window and thrown a homeless man into the ocean.</p><p data-characters=723 data-current-count=723 data-injectable=true>Van der Sloot’s childhood was marked with signs of a troubled youth; he was involved with numerous minor offenses, from theft to vandalism. He even moved into the family’s guesthouse <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to keep his nightly escapades secret</a> from his parents. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">On a typical night</a>, van der Sloot could be found at the casino, and partying at late-night bars, where he was accused of slipping date-rape drugs into women’s drinks. A former FBI investigator who was looking into Natalee Holloway’s disappearance found at least one woman willing to testify against van der Sloot – unfortunately, she changed her mind. Despite it being fairly public knowledge, officials have no explanation for why these complaints were never followed up on.</p><p data-characters=604 data-current-count=604 data-injectable=true>Kees van der Spek thinks the mystery is actually pretty straightforward. He’s recounted stories of his father enabling his brother by giving him money to gamble at the casino and allowing him to drive through both activities are illegal in Aruba until after one’s 18th birthday. It was rumored that van der Sloot was frequenting internet forums, soliciting couples for sex. But when police tried to investigate, the inquiry soon disappeared. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Van der Spek told truTV</a>, “What I do know is that Joran was the boss of his father and mother. He would tell them what to do and not the other way around.”</p><p data-characters=592 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true>His behavior was dotted by incredibly selfish acts. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick van der Eem wrote</a> in his book Overboard that if van der Sloot asked him to bring over food or drink, he only ever secured enough for himself. Van der Eem claims that he then ate in front of his obviously hungry roommates. Likewise, when van der Sloot was caught on tape recounting one of many different versions of Natalee’s death, he focused on how it affected him personally. He claimed that Natalee had a seizure, and as the young woman was dying he, “…was nearly in tears thinking ‘Why must this s**t happen to me?’”</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FBI profiler Clint van Zandt thinks</a> Sloot’s behavior means he’s likely, “a pathological liar…. The only time he will tell the truth about anything is when he believes it is in his best self-interest at the exclusion of anyone else on the planet.” It’s hard to diagnose without speaking to a patient but throw in some sociopathy, a healthy dose of narcissism, and some serious antisocial tendencies and we might be on to something.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahmK1lp5bAbrbOq5inZaaWu26wxKtkrKSfpMG0ecKhoKWcmKS8pXnLoqKeZZWtva270Z6baA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./where-is-michelle-ryan-in-2022.html>&#171;&nbsp;Where Is Michelle Ryan In 2022?</a>
