Feel free to leave any reactions in the comment section below.</p><p>This is the final Monday Night RAW as we head into the Royal Rumble on Sunday. With that in mind, Brock Lesnar and Bobby Lashley will have a weigh-in for their upcoming WWE Championship bout. The two behemoths will almost certainly come to blows ahead of their much anticipated match, and we can’t wait to see how it plays out.</p><p>Elsewhere tonight, Alpha Academy will take-on RK-Bro in a series of Academic challenges in order to prove their intellectual superiority, Becky Lynch and Doudrop will come face-to-face once more before their match for the RAW Women’s Championship, and The Miz will throw a big birthday bash for Maryse, which we’re confident Edge and Beth Phoenix will be in attendance for.</p><p>And that’s the preview for tonight’s RAW. Our live coverage will begin from 8PM right here. Let us know if you’re excited about any of it and remember to hit the refresh link below and enjoy the show!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-raw>RAW</h2><p>Monday Night RAW is live and Corey Graves and Adam Pearce are in the ring for the weigh-in. Pearce welcomes us to the show, then introduces the All Mighty Bobby Lashley, accompanied by MVP.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Before Corey Graces can introduce his challenger, Paul Heyman walks out onto the stage. Heyman says he’s tired of people stealing his schtick, and so he introcuces the WWE Champion, Brock Lesnar, as only he can. Lesnar comes out wearing a cowboy hat and does a lap of the ring before getting inside and staring at Lashley.</p><p>Graves tells Brock is attire is not right for a weigh-in and Brock asks if he’d rather him naked? Lashley is the first man onto the scale and clocks in at 273lbs. MVP says that’s 273lbs of killing machine. Bottled lightning. More God than man. Something Brock won’t be able to contend with come Saturday night. Some said that match would never take place but Bobby knew it was inevitable. And after the Royal Rumble Lashley will actually gain some weight, the exact weight of the title belt.</p><p>Lesnar takes of his hat and gives it to Heyman, then he steps on the scale and weighs-in at 286lbs. Lashley says this is pissing him off because Brock isn’t taking it seriously. Lesnar just laughs. Lashley says this will be the shortest title reign of Brock’s career, and that’s not a prediction… it’s a spoiler. Lesnar says Lashley is the real comedian. Brock says picture this: on Sunday morning, hot off the press, Bobby Lashley beats Brock Lesnar with The Hurt Lock, and we have a new Champion. Bobby who? Lesnar leaves with Heyman and Lashley isn’t happy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>We see a replay of Bianca Belair winning the Royal Rumble last year, then going on to beat Sasha Banks at WrestleMania to become the SmackDown Women’s Champion.

Kevin Patrick then introduces the former Tag Champ’s, RK-Bro, who make their way to the ring for the spelling bee.</p><p>The spelling bee gets underway and Otis spells his first word correctly. Riddle is up next and he’s asked to spell “calibration”. Riddle asks for it to be used in a sentence, then asks Patrick to use it in letters. Riddle realises its what he does to set his scales when he’s weighing grams and spells it correctly. Gable steps up to the plate and is asked to spell “disillusion” and he laughs, saying it’s too easy. Gable then spells “dissolution” because he would’t let Patrick give a definition. He blames Patrick’s Irish accent.</p><p>Randy Orton steps up and tells Gable to sit the Hell down. Patrick asks Randy to spell “dumbbell” and if he gets it right RK-Bro will win the competition. Orton spells it correctly! Gable gets angry and says Orton’s word was too easy. Orton says he should shut Gable’s mouth, and suggests a match right now. Orton spells out how he’s going to beat Gable: R-K-O.</p><p>*Commercial Break*</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Randy Orton W/Riddle Vs Gable W/Otis</h2><p>The match begins with a lock-up and Gable grabs a wristlock.

Gable practically faints.</p><p>*Commercial Break*</p><p>Alexa Bliss is still in therapy and her therapist says they’re making progress.

Lynch says she’s still waiting on a thank you for inspiring Doudrop, for getting her into WWE, for getting her a title shot.
